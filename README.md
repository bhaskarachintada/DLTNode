Probabilistic volumetric speckle suppression in OCT using deep learning

DL-TNode-3D is a deep learning framework for volumetric speckle reduction in OCT based on a conditional generative adversarial network that leverages the volumetric nature of OCT data and uses the ground truth obtained from a high-quality volumetric non-local means de-speckling method.

Additional information regarding this OCT speckle suppression framework will be available shortly!
